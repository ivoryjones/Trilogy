<p class="terms"><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong><br>Welcome to Trilogy Mentors service!  By checking the “I Accept” button on the

previous page, families (or “clients”) are agreeing on behalf of themselves and 

anyone for whom the family procure services through the Trilogy Mentors that the 

family will be legally bound to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this 

Client Referral Agreement (the “Agreement”).  Do not click the “I Accept” button if 

the family does not agree to be bound by this Agreement.  If the family does not 

click the “I Accept” button, the family will not be permitted to register to use our 

referral services.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement are as follows.<br>

1.    Registration for a Trilogy Mentors Family Member Account: In order to use 

the Trilogy Mentors services, the families will be required to provide to us certain 

personal information, such as The families’ name, address, phone number and e-

mail address.  The families may also choose to provide to us specific information 

about the families’ children and the families’ household (e.g., allergies, food 

preferences, pets, etc.) or the families’ preferences for particular childcare 

service providers whom we have accepted through our selection process 

(described in more detail below) to be eligible for referral by us to our service 

providers (the “Mentors”).  All of this information will be used and protected in 

accordance with the Trilogy Mentors Privacy Policy, located at PRIVACY 

POLICY and which is hereby incorporated into and governed by this Agreement.  

By the families’ acceptance of this Agreement, the families are representing that 

they have carefully read and understand the Trilogy Mentors Privacy Policy, and 

agree to its terms. The families also represent that all information they provide to 

us through our website is accurate and that the families will keep it up-to-date.  

Trilogy Mentors will not be responsible or liable to the families in any manner 

whatsoever for any costs, expenses or damages incurred by the families, which 

result or arise from the inaccuracy or expiration of information the families 

provide to us.<br>

2.    Mentor Selection Process:  All Mentors using this service are current 

University of Virginia students who are interviewed by Trilogy Mentors before 

becoming a mentor.  We conduct screening interviews of candidates and may 

check candidate references, but despite these reasonable efforts to screen 

candidates, the families acknowledge that selection of Mentors is a subjective 

process, and that therefore we DO NOT WARRANT the quality of services to be 

provided by a particular Mentor.<br>

3.      Our Service Fees:  At the families request, we will make available to the 

families the opportunity to request an appointment for the services of a Mentor.  

Appointments will be processed and confirmed in accordance with the 

instructions set forth Book a Mentor. In consideration of our services, we will 

charge the families applicable fees in accordance with our Rates and Policies set 

forth at Rates and Policies, which the families represent they have read and 

understand. We disclaim that all payments will be done through our secure online 

payments network powered by Blue Swype.<br>

4.    Trilogy Mentors are NOT Trilogy Mentors Employees.  Mentors are NOT our 

employees.  We are a referral agency.  Mentors are independent contractors.  

The families are solely responsible for determining, agreeing with a Mentor the 

exact nature of the services to be provided and the manner in which such 

services will be carried out, and paying the amount on the site in accordance with 

the rates set forth at Rates and Policies. The families are responsible for 

complying with all applicable laws (including without limitation local, state and 

federal tax laws) that are applicable to a Mentor’s provision of services to the 

family, and the family will indemnify and hold us, our owners and employees from 

and against any claims against us arising out of or relating to the familis’ failure to 

comply with such laws.<br>

5.  Non-Solicitation:  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of one 

(1) year following its termination or expiration, the families agree not to:  (i) solicit 

or induce any employee or independent contractor to terminate or breach an 

employment, contractual or other relationship with us; or (ii) solicit any Mentor of 

whom the families become aware through a referral by us to employ or contract 

with Mentor for child-care services other than through our services.  The families 

agree that their breach of this Section will cause substantial damages to Trilogy 

Mentors may be difficult if not impossible to quantify.  Accordingly, in the event of 

such a breach by the family, the family will pay $5,000 in liquidated damages to 

Trilogy Mentors as a reasonable estimate of such damages and not a penalty.<br>

6.    Disclaimer:  We are not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for 

the acts or omissions of any Mentor while providing services to the families or the 

loss or damage arising there from.  TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER 

APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH 

OUR SERVICES OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MENTORS AND 

HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, 

IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.  The families will indemnify and hold us, our owners 

and employees from and against any claims by the families or any third party 

arising out of or relating to the acts or omissions of any Mentor.<br>

7.    Limitation of Liability:  In no event will we be liable to the families for any 

punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages in connection with this 

Agreement or the acts or omissions of any Mentor.  In no event will our liability to 

the families for any claims by the families under this Agreement exceed the 

greater of Booking Fees paid by the families to us in the twelve (12) months 

preceding the claim or $1,000.<br>

8.    Disputes:  Except in the case of an action relating to breach by the families 

of Section 5 above (which may be brought in any court with appropriate 

jurisdiction), the families agree that all disputes arising under or relating to this 

Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration in Virginia before a single 

arbitrator under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association in 

accordance with its then-current rules for commercial arbitration.  THE FAMILIES 

EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE 

FAMILIES ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY CLAIM 

ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.<br>

9.   Amendments: Termination.  We may amend this Agreement at any time upon 

notice posted to our website, and the families’ continued use of this website 

constitutes their acceptance thereof.  Otherwise, the Agreement may not be 

amended without the written agreement of both us and the families.  Either we or 

the families may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other.  

Sections 4-10 shall survive any such termination.<br>

10.    Miscellaneous:  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State 

of Virginia.  It constitutes the entire agreement between us and the families, and 

supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous written or verbal representations 

by any party.  If any portion of this Agreement is or is deemed to be invalid or 

unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>

I HEREBY REPRESENT THAT I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS 

AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.<br><br>

Privacy Policy For Mentors

Trilogy Mentors and its directly affiliated web domains

Trilogy Mentors and its directly affiliated domain and DBA Trilogy Mentors.com, 

(“Trilogy Mentors”, “we”, “us” or “our”) understand the importance of maintaining 

the confidentiality of our clients’ personal information and is committed to 

ensuring the security of any information provided by our clients through all our 

affiliated website, (the “Site”).

Active Collection of Personal Information

To access or take advantage of features of the Site, we request that the Mentor 

provides personal information. “Personal Information” is information about the 

Mentor that is associated with his or her name or identity, such as, name, mailing 

address, e-mail address, and telephone number. This required information is 

necessary for us to provide the Mentor services, including processing 

transactions, issuing a new password if the Mentor forgets or loses the 

password, and contacting the Mentor should the need arise in connection with 

providing our service.

Passive Collection of Information

In addition to the Personal Information that the Mentor actively provides to us, we 

or our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to 

automatically collect information about the Mentor when the Mentor uses the 

Site. This information may include Demographic Information, browser type, 

operating system, clickstream data, IP address, mobile device identifiers and 

other information.
The methods that we and our service providers may use to 

automatically collect such information include the following:

Cookies

Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a 

web site. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without 

limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Site. 

The Mentor may disable cookies using the Mentor’s browser’s preferences. 

However, some features of the Site may not function properly or may operate 

slowly if the Mentor disables the cookies.

Web Beacons

We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as 

“Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web 

beacons may be invisible to the Mentor, but any electronic image inserted into a 

web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or 

similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to 

count the number of visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, 

to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or to count how 

many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

Embedded Scripts

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information 

about the Mentor’s interactions with the Site. It is temporarily downloaded onto 

the Mentor’s computer from our web server or a third party we work with, is 

active only while the Mentor is connected to the Site, and is deleted or 

deactivated thereafter. Mobile Device Identifiers: Certain mobile service providers 

uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may 

receive such device information if the Mentor accesses the Site through mobile 

devices. Certain features of the Site may require collection of mobile phone 

numbers and we may associate that phone number with the mobile device 

identifiers. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems 

that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on 

the provider, we and our third-party service providers may receive this 

information. 
If we associate any such passively-collected information with 

Personal Information about the Mentor, we will treat the combined information as 

Personal Information.
